# Calendar to Task Sync

A Google Apps Script that automatically syncs specific calendar events to Google Tasks, creating a seamless workflow for tracking watchlists, entertainment queues, or any calendar-based TODO system.

## üéØ What It Does

Automatically collects all "unwatched" shows/movies from your calendar (marked with a specific color) into a single task list. 

Instead of scrolling through multiple months of calendar views trying to spot unwatched items among all your other events and calendars, you just open one task list and pick what to watch next.

**How it works:**
1. You mark calendar events with a color (e.g., Peacock = unwatched)
2. Script creates tasks in your dedicated task list
3. You complete the task when watched ‚Üí script removes the task and resets the calendar event color

**Usage Example:**

1. **Friday, Nov 7**: "_Frankensteine_" comes to Netflix. You create a calendar event with the default color.
2. **You get busy**: Don't watch it that day. Later that week, you manually change the event color to Peacock (7) to mark it as "unwatched."
3. **Script runs on schedule**: A task "_Frankensteine (11/07/2025)_" appears in your "Media Backlog" task list.
4. **Two months later**: Instead of scrolling through October, November, December, January calendars looking for Peacock-colored events, you just open "Media Backlog." task list.
5. **Pick and watch**: You see "_Frankensteine_" in the list, watch it, and mark the task as completed.
6. **Script cleans up**: The calendar event changes back to default color, and the completed task is removed.

Your task list becomes your single source of truth for "_what haven't I watched yet?_"

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Google Account** with access to:
  - Google Calendar
  - Google Tasks
- **Google Apps Script** project (free)

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Google Apps Script Project

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Delete the default code
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of [`calendar_to_task.js`](calendar_to_task.js)
5. Name your project (e.g., "Calendar Task Sync")

### Step 2: Enable Google Tasks API

1. In your Apps Script project, click **Services** (‚äï icon in the left sidebar)
2. Find **Google Tasks API** in the list
3. Click **Add**

### Step 3: Configure the Script

At the top of the script, update these configuration constants to match your setup:

```javascript
const CALENDAR_NAME = 'Entertainment';     // Your calendar name
const TASK_LIST_NAME = 'Media Backlog';    // Your task list name
const UNWATCHED_COLOR_ID = '7';            // Color for unwatched items
const DEFAULT_COLOR_ID = '11';             // Default color of the calendar
```

#### Finding Calendar Color IDs

Google Calendar uses numeric color IDs:
- `'1'` = Lavender
- `'2'` = Sage
- `'3'` = Grape
- `'4'` = Flamingo
- `'5'` = Banana
- `'6'` = Tangerine
- `'7'` = Peacock
- `'8'` = Graphite
- `'9'` = Blueberry
- `'10'` = Basil
- `'11'` = Tomato

### Step 4: Run the Script Manually (First Time)

1. Select the `syncCalendarAndTasks` function from the dropdown
2. Click **Run** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
3. You'll be prompted to authorize the script:
   - Click **Review Permissions**
   - Select your Google account
   - Click **Advanced** ‚Üí **Go to [Your Project Name] (unsafe)**
   - Click **Allow**

### Step 5: Set Up Automated Triggers (Optional but Recommended)

To run the sync automatically:

1. In Apps Script, click **Triggers** (‚è∞ icon in the left sidebar)
2. Click **Add Trigger**
3. Configure:
   - **Choose which function to run**: `syncCalendarAndTasks`
   - **Choose which deployment**: `Head`
   - **Select event source**: `Time-driven`
   - **Select type of time based trigger**: `Hour timer`
   - **Select hour interval**: `Every hour` (or your preference)
4. Click **Save**

The script will now run automatically at your chosen interval.

## üîß How It Works

The script operates in three phases:

### Phase 1: Create Tasks for Unwatched Events
- Scans the last 6 months of your specified calendar
- Finds events with the "unwatched" color that aren't recurring
- Creates corresponding tasks in your task list (if they don't already exist)
- Each task includes the event title, date, and location (e.g. streaming platform)

### Phase 2: Remove Stale Tasks
- Checks existing tasks in the task list
- If the corresponding calendar event no longer exists or has been marked as watched (default color), the task is deleted

### Phase 3: Mark Events as Watched
- If a task is marked as completed in Google Tasks, 
- The script automatically updates the corresponding calendar event to the "watched" color
- Deleted the completed task from the task list
- This closes the loop and keeps everything in sync

## üêû Troubleshooting

### No tasks are being created
- Verify the `CALENDAR_NAME` exactly matches your calendar name (case-sensitive)
- Confirm the `TASK_LIST_NAME` matches an existing task list
- Check that your events have the correct color ID
- Run the script manually and check **Execution log** for errors

### Tasks aren't deleting
- Make sure the script has permission to both read and write tasks

### Color isn't updating
- Verify you have edit permissions on the calendar events
- Ensure the `DEFAULT_COLOR_ID` is a valid color (1-11)

### View execution logs
1. In Apps Script, click **Executions** in the left sidebar
2. Click on a recent execution to see detailed logs
3. Look for `Created:`, `Deleted:`, and `Reset:` counts
